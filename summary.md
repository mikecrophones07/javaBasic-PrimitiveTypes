Questions: 
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
2.Why the test failed at first?
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?

TEST1 - should_perform_logical_boolean_operations
1. to check whether youre understanding logical operators is right. official document : https://www.dummies.com/programming/java/logical-operators-in-java/
2. wrong answers in the expected out of logical operands
3. to match the expected output to the actual true result
4. none

TEST2 - should_do_bitwise_and_boolean_operation
1. To check how will you apply bitwise operation in hex value and know to convert values to apply logical operands https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/bitwise-operators
2. wrong answer due to applying bitwise operation in 2 binaries -> hex was converted to binary to answer easily the value
3. to correct the expected result base on the calculated bitwise operation
4. None

TEST3 - should_do_bitwise_or_boolean_operation
1. To check how will you apply bitwise operation in hex value and know to convert values to apply logical operands https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/bitwise-operators
2. wrong answer due to applying or bitwise operation in 2 binaries -> hex was converted to binary to answer easily the value
3. to correct the expected result base on the calculated bitwise operation
4. None
