Questions: 
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
2.Why the test failed at first?
3.Why you corrected the test that way?
4.Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?

-- BooleanOperatorsTest --
TEST1 - should_perform_logical_boolean_operations
1. to check whether youre understanding logical operators is right. official document : https://www.dummies.com/programming/java/logical-operators-in-java/
2. wrong answers in the expected out of logical operands
3. to match the expected output to the actual true result
4. none

TEST2 - should_do_bitwise_and_boolean_operation
1. To check how will you apply bitwise operation in hex value and know to convert values to apply logical operands https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/bitwise-operators
2. wrong answer due to applying bitwise operation in 2 binaries -> hex was converted to binary to answer easily the value
3. to correct the expected result base on the calculated bitwise operation
4. None

TEST3 - should_do_bitwise_or_boolean_operation
1. To check how will you apply bitwise operation in hex value and know to convert values to apply logical operands https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/bitwise-operators
2. wrong answer due to applying or bitwise operation in 2 binaries -> hex was converted to binary to answer easily the value
3. to correct the expected result base on the calculated bitwise operation
4. None

TEST4 - should_do_bitwise_not_operation
1. to compute the value of the converted value of hex to binary and adding not that will reverse the value of the answer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2513525/bitwise-not-operator
2. wrong answer due to wrong conversion of hex -> decimal value and didnt get the application of not operator
3. i can sense that by solving the real answer, i can understand how to apply bitwise not operator in the value given decimal.
4. None

-- CharTypeTest --
TEST 1 should_describe_escaped_chars
1. to check whether we know what is escaped characters that is used in text https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1367322/what-are-all-the-escape-characters
2. wrong answer due to some escaped characters that didn't know its real value
3. tried to correct the answer base from the understanding of what escaped character is
4. None

-- FloatingTypeTest --
TEST 1 should_not_get_rounded_result_if_convert_floating_number_to_integer
1. to know how to convert float to integer without rounding https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17061375/converting-float-to-int-without-rounding
2. didn't know how to convert float to int without rounding
3. to pass the test and to test whether the real value is correct to the expected value
4. None

TEST 2 should_judge_special_double_cases
1. to know the difference of finite and infinite and not a number https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8311604/check-if-a-double-is-infinite-in-java/8311657 | https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/double-isnan-method-in-java-with-examples/
2. didn't what is finite & inifinity and not a number
3. to check and validate is double is infinite and not a number
4. None

TEST 3 should_not_round_number_when_convert_to_integer
1. to know how to convert float to integer without rounding https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17061375/converting-float-to-int-without-rounding
2. didn't know how to convert float to int without rounding
3. to pass the test and to test whether the real value is correct to the expected value
4. None

TEST 4 should_round_number
1. to know if the value will be rounded up and converted to long
2. no test error happened
3. no correction happened since i only run the test once
4. None

-- IntegerTypeTest --
TEST 1 should_get_range_of_primitive_int_type
1. to know a property that identify max and min limit of integer
2. no test error happened
3. no correction happened since i only run the test once
4. None

TEST 2 should_get_range_of_primitive_short_type
1. to know a property that identify max and min limit of Short
2. no test error happened
3. no correction happened since i only run the test once
4. None

TEST 3 should_get_range_of_primitive_long_type
1. to know a property that identify max and min limit of Long
2. no test error happened
3. no correction happened since i only run the test once
4. None
